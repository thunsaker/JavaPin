##JavaPin

This is a basic API wrapper built for [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com). Their [API](http://pinterest.com/developers/api) is not fully available so this contains only the Popular Pins and User (Information) endpoint, which require no authentication.

Check out my [JavaPin Demo App](https://github.com/thunsaker/JavaPinDemo) (for Android) to see the library in use.
